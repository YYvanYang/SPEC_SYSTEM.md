Transform all requirements into strict EARS format:
"WHEN [trigger condition], THE SYSTEM SHALL [expected behavior]"

For each requirement:

1. Ensure clarity and testability
2. Define positive and negative test cases
3. Specify measurable acceptance criteria
4. Identify edge cases and error conditions
5. Link to business value and user needs

Quality gates:

- All requirements use EARS format
- Each has â‰¥3 test scenarios (happy path, edge case, error case)
- Acceptance criteria are measurable and time-bound
- Negative cases explicitly defined
