- ❌ Missing traceability between specs and implementation
- ❌ Manual, error-prone review processes
- ❌ Inconsistent code quality and architecture decisions
- ❌ Poor knowledge transfer and documentation

### AI-Native Solution:

- ✅ **Specialized Sub-Agents** for each development phase
- ✅ **Intelligent Orchestration** of workflows
- ✅ **Automated Quality Gates** with continuous feedback
- ✅ **Living Documentation** that evolves with code
- ✅ **Context-Aware Decision Making** through agent collaboration

---

## 1) Agent-Centric Architecture

### 1.1 Core Agent Types

**Strategic Layer:**

- `@steering-architect` - Project vision, tech strategy, and high-level planning
- `@feature-planner` - Feature breakdown, prioritization, and dependency analysis
- `@design-architect` - System design, architecture decisions, and technical trade-offs

**Execution Layer:**

- `@requirements-engineer` - EARS-compliant requirements with acceptance criteria
- `@implementation-specialist` - Code implementation following specs precisely
- `@test-strategist` - Comprehensive testing strategy and execution
- `@quality-guardian` - Code review, security, and compliance checks

**Knowledge Layer:**

- `@documentation-curator` - Living docs, ADRs, and knowledge management
- `@metrics-analyst` - Performance tracking, delivery metrics, and insights

## 2) Intelligent Workflow Orchestration

### 2.1 Phase-Gate Model

**Phase 1: Strategic Planning**

```
@steering-architect analyze-project requirements.md
@feature-planner break-down-features epic.md
@design-architect create-system-design architecture.md
```

**Phase 2: Detailed Specification**

```
@requirements-engineer normalize-requirements features/*.md
@design-architect detail-components components/*.md
@test-strategist plan-testing-strategy test-plan.md
```

**Phase 3: Implementation**

```
@implementation-specialist implement-feature task-1.md
@test-strategist run-tests task-1.md
@quality-guardian review-implementation task-1.md
```

**Phase 4: Integration & Delivery**

```
@documentation-curator update-docs changelog.md
@metrics-analyst track-delivery-metrics metrics.md
@steering-architect validate-delivery acceptance.md
```

### 2.2 Dynamic Workflow Adaptation

- **Context-Aware Routing**: Route tasks to appropriate agents based on complexity and type
- **Feedback Loops**: Agents can request spec clarifications or design changes
- **Parallel Processing**: Independent tasks executed concurrently by multiple agents
- **Quality Gates**: Automated checkpoints that must pass before proceeding

    this.preferences = new Map(); // User/team preferences
  }

  learn(outcome, context) {
    if (outcome.success) {
      this.patterns.set(context.hash(), outcome.approach);
    } else {
      this.antiPatterns.set(context.hash(), outcome.failure);
    }
  }

  recommend(context) {
