**Transform from "vibe coding" to AI-orchestrated spec-driven development** using specialized sub-agents, intelligent workflows, and automated quality gates.

## 🎯 Vision

Enable **10x faster delivery with higher quality** through systematic, AI-orchestrated development processes that eliminate manual inefficiencies and ensure consistent quality.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Specialized AI Agents

**Strategic Layer:**
- `@steering-architect` - Project vision, technical strategy, and delivery oversight
- `@feature-planner` - Feature breakdown, prioritization, and dependency analysis  
- `@design-architect` - System design, architecture decisions, and technical trade-offs

**Execution Layer:**
- `@requirements-engineer` - EARS-compliant requirements with acceptance criteria
- `@implementation-specialist` - Code implementation following specs precisely
- `@test-strategist` - Comprehensive testing strategy and execution

**Quality & Knowledge Layer:**
- `@quality-guardian` - Code review, security, and compliance checks
- `@documentation-curator` - Living docs, ADRs, and knowledge management
- `@metrics-analyst` - Performance tracking, delivery metrics, and insights

### Intelligent Workflows

```mermaid
graph TD
    SA[steering-architect] --> FP[feature-planner]
    FP --> RE[requirements-engineer]
    FP --> DA[design-architect]
    RE --> IS[implementation-specialist]
    DA --> IS
    IS --> TS[test-strategist]
    TS --> QG[quality-guardian]
    QG --> DC[documentation-curator]
    DC --> MA[metrics-analyst]
    MA --> SA
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Plan a Feature
```bash
/plan-feature user-authentication
```
Orchestrates complete feature planning through all strategic agents.

### 2. Implement Tasks
```bash
/implement-task auth-login-001
```
Executes structured implementation workflow with quality assurance.

### 3. Review & Deploy
```bash
/review-ready auth-feature
```
Triggers comprehensive multi-agent review before deployment.

## 📊 Analytics Dashboard

Monitor delivery and quality metrics in real-time:
```bash
/analytics-dashboard
```

Track:
- **Delivery**: Cycle time, throughput, deployment frequency
- **Quality**: Defect rates, test coverage, security vulnerabilities  
- **Team**: Agent collaboration efficiency, knowledge transfer
- **Business**: Feature adoption, user satisfaction, ROI

## 🏁 Quality Gates

Automated quality pipeline ensures:
- ✅ All requirements use EARS format
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (≥80%)
- ✅ Security vulnerabilities resolved
- ✅ Performance benchmarks met
- ✅ Documentation completeness
- ✅ Code quality standards

## 🔧 Configuration

The system is configured through `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "context-sharing": true,
    "memory-persistence": true,
    "learning-enabled": true,
    "orchestration-mode": "intelligent"
  },
  "workflows": {
    "feature-lifecycle": {
      "enabled": true,
      "auto-routing": true,
      "quality-gates": "strict"
    }
  },
  "metrics": {
    "collection-interval": "1h",
    "dashboard-refresh": "5m",
    "predictive-analytics": true
  }
}
```

## 🎓 Learning System

Agents continuously learn from:
- **Successful Patterns**: Proven approaches for similar contexts
- **Anti-Patterns**: Failed approaches to avoid
- **Team Preferences**: Established conventions and choices
- **Quality Outcomes**: Correlation between approaches and results

## 🛡️ Security & Quality

- **Protected Paths**: Core system files require approval for modifications
- **Automated Checks**: Style, security, and quality validation on all changes
- **Metrics Tracking**: Continuous monitoring of delivery and quality indicators
- **Escalation Rules**: Automatic escalation for quality gate failures
